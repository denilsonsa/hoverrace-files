# HoverRace files

This is an experimental repository trying to read (and potentially write) files from the [HoverRace][] game ([also available on Steam][steam]).

Specifically, it would be nice to have a parser for the `*.trk` track files.

This repository is still in early stages, not ready for use.

TODO: After I get this in a nice state, I should [post about it at Discord](https://discord.com/channels/890153069705322546/890153070242185247).
